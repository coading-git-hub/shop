# Simple Fix for Clerk TypeScript Error

## Problem
The TypeScript error in `components/Header.tsx` at line 12:
```
[ts] Could not find a declaration file for module '@clerk/nextjs/server'. 'c:/Users/FATTANI COMPUTERS/Desktop/shopcartyt/shopcartyt/node_modules/@clerk/nextjs/dist/esm/server/index.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

## Simple Solution
Create a minimal declaration file to resolve the TypeScript error.

Create a file `clerk-nextjs-server.d.ts` in the project root with the following content:
```typescript
declare module "@clerk/nextjs/server" {
  export function auth(): any;
  export function currentUser(): Promise<any>;
}
```

This minimal declaration file will tell TypeScript that the module exists and what functions it exports, which should resolve the error.

## Alternative Solution
If creating a declaration file is not possible, you can also try changing the import statement to:
```typescript
// @ts-ignore
import { auth, currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
```

However, this is not recommended as it bypasses TypeScript checking.

## Recommended Approach
1. Create the declaration file as described above
2. If that doesn't work, try installing the missing type definitions:
   ```bash
   npm i --save-dev @types/clerk__nextjs
   ```
3. As a last resort, reinstall the Clerk package:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall @clerk/nextjs
   npm install @clerk/nextjs
